# Tskit statistical genetics workshop using JupyterLite

[![lite-badge](https://jupyterlite.rtfd.io/en/latest/_static/badge.svg)](https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo)

Try it at https://hyanwong.github.io/workshop-pages. The first notebook can be accessed directly using https://hyanwong.github.io/workshop-pages/lab?path=Workshop1.ipynb. Using Chrome is recommended.

IMPORTANT NOTE: A bug in tskit 0.5.4 means that 3 of the exercises in Workbook1, involving printing alleles associated with variants, will not work until a new version of
[pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) (>0.23.2) is released, presumably late June 2023.

You can load your own files into the "data" directory by clicking on the "Upload files" button (like an arrow with a bar underneath: ⬆︎) in the file browser tab on the left hand side.
